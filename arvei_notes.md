## 2. Excuting long jobs (up to 60 hours):

	qsub -l big ...

## 3. Problems installing lxml

Initially I managed to install lxml==4.2.1 but I don't know how. Maybe an update in arvei changed the environment. Two dependencies seem to be wrong:

which xml2-config
which xslt-config

I solved the first one with:

	CFLAGS=-I/usr/include/libxml2 pip install lxml

But not the second one. Finally y downloaded the wheel:

wget --no-check-certificate https://www.silx.org/pub/wheelhouse/old/lxml-3.4.4-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
